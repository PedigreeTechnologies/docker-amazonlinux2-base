# Amazon Linux 2 Image

[![CI][Actions]][ActionsBuild] [![Docker pulls][DockerImg]][Docker]

Amazon Linux 2 Docker container.

## Tags

- `latest`: Latest successful build of the Amazon Linux 2 container.

## How to Build

This image is built on Docker Hub automatically any time the upstream OS container is rebuilt, and any time a commit is made or merged to the `master` branch. But if you need to build the image on your own locally, do the following:

  1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
  2. Clone this repo locally on your machine.
  3. `cd` into the root repo directory.
  4. Run `docker build -t amazonlinux2-base .`

## How to Use

  1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
  2. Pull this image from Docker Hub: `docker pull pedigreetechnologies/docker-amazonlinux2-base:latest` (or use the image you built earlier, e.g. `amazonlinux2-ansible:latest`).
  3. Run a container from the image: `docker run --detach --privileged  pedigreetechnologies/docker-amazonlinux2-base:latest`
